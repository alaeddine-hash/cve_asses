          "explanation": "The vulnerability specifically arises when Jitsi Meet is configured to use both lobby mode and password protection. In this configuration, users waiting in the lobby can be invited to the main meeting, which triggers the flaw that discloses the meeting password. Without this specific setup, the vulnerability does not manifest."

      ],
      "general_explanation": "The exploitation of CVE-2024-33530 is limited to environments where Jitsi Meet is deployed with both lobby and password protection enabled. The flaw is rooted in the logic of how users are granted access to meetings, allowing password disclosure when users are invited from the lobby."
