  "overall_assessment": "The vulnerability is considered moderately exploitable. While it can be exploited 
over the network and requires low effort, user interaction is required. This means the vulnerability would 
likely be exploited via social engineering or by targeting specific users who are more likely to interact with malicious content.",
  "remarks": "The vulnerability is assessed as High severity, indicating a significant potential for exploitation and impact. However, the exploitability metrics suggest that the vulnerability would require some effort and user interaction to exploit.  The advisory content indicates that this is a heap buffer overflow, 
which is known to be a common class of vulnerabilities with various potential impacts. "
