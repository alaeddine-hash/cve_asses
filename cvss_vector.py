As a cybersecurity expert specializing in vulnerability assessment and familiar with CVSS v3.1, your **core task is to classify each CVSS base metric** for the given CVE. You will analyze the CVE details and advisory contents to determine the most accurate value for each metric, based solely on the information provided.

**CVE Details:**
- **CVE ID:** {cve['cve_id']}
- **Description:** {cve['description']}

**Advisory Contents:**
"""
    # Include advisory contents if available
    for advisory in cve.get('advisory_contents', []):
        prompt += f"\n- **URL:** {advisory['url']}\n**Content:**\n{advisory['content']}\n"

    prompt += """
**Instructions:**

1. **Carefully read and analyze** the CVE description and advisory contents provided.

2. **Classify each CVSS v3.1 base metric** by selecting the most appropriate value based on the information given. Use only the single-letter abbreviations provided.

   - **Attack Vector (AV):**
     - **N (Network):** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over a network.
     - **A (Adjacent):** Attack requires access to the local network or subnet.
     - **L (Local):** Attack requires local access to the system.
     - **P (Physical):** Attack requires physical interaction with the device.

   - **Attack Complexity (AC):**
     - **L (Low):** The attack does not require special conditions; it's straightforward.
     - **H (High):** The attack requires specific conditions or configurations.

   - **Privileges Required (PR):**
     - **N (None):** No privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.
     - **L (Low):** Requires basic user privileges.
     - **H (High):** Requires elevated or administrative privileges.

   - **User Interaction (UI):**
     - **N (None):** No user interaction is required.
     - **R (Required):** Exploitation requires user action (e.g., clicking a link).

   - **Scope (S):**
     - **U (Unchanged):** The impact is confined to the vulnerable component.
     - **C (Changed):** The vulnerability can affect components beyond its security scope.

   - **Confidentiality Impact (C):**
     - **N (None):** No impact on confidentiality.
     - **L (Low):** Limited disclosure of data; attacker gains access to some information.
     - **H (High):** Total information disclosure; all data is compromised.

   - **Integrity Impact (I):**
     - **N (None):** No impact on integrity.
     - **L (Low):** Modification of some data without control over the outcome.
     - **H (High):** Complete loss of integrity; attacker can modify any data.

   - **Availability Impact (A):**
     - **N (None):** No impact on availability.
     - **L (Low):** Reduced performance or interruptions in resource availability.
     - **H (High):** Complete shutdown of the affected component.

3. **Generate the CVSS vector string** by combining your classifications in the following exact format:
CVSS:3.1/AV:[AV]/AC:[AC]/PR:[PR]/UI:[UI]/S:[S]/C:[C]/I:[I]/A:[A]

**Important Guidelines:**

- **Focus on accurate classification**: Ensure each metric is correctly classified based on the provided details.
- **Use only** the single-letter abbreviations specified (e.g., N, L, H).
- **Do not include** any additional text, explanations, or reasoning in your response.
- **Your response must be only** the CVSS vector string in the exact format provided.
- **Do not add** any introductory or concluding remarks.
- **Do not mention** any tools, external resources, or personal opinions.
